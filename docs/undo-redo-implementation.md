# Undo/Redo Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented full undo/redo functionality for the Pix3 editor using the existing **OperationService** infrastructure with a Command-to-Operation adapter pattern.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. CommandOperationAdapter (`src/core/commands/CommandOperationAdapter.ts`)
A bridge that wraps Commands to work as Operations, allowing them to integrate with the existing **OperationService**:

Key features:

### 2. Command Undo/Redo Support
Updated commands to implement undo/redo methods:

#### UpdateObjectPropertyCommand

#### SelectObjectCommand  

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
Registered in `Pix3EditorShell` component:

### 4. UI Component Integration
Updated all UI components to use **OperationService** with wrapped commands:


### Command Lifecycle (Using OperationService)
```
User Action → Command Created → Wrap with Adapter → OperationService.invokeAndPush()
                                                              ↓
                                                  Preconditions → Execute → PostCommit
                                                              ↓
                                                  Create OperationCommit with undo/redo
                                                              ↓
                                                  HistoryManager.push()
```

### Undo Flow
```
User: Cmd+Z → operationService.undo() → HistoryManager.undo()
                                              ↓
                                  Call stored undo() function from OperationCommit
                                              ↓
                                  Command's undo() method restores previous state
```

### Redo Flow  
```
User: Shift+Cmd+Z → operationService.redo() → HistoryManager.redo()
                                                    ↓
                                        Call stored redo() function from OperationCommit
                                                    ↓
                                        Command's redo() method re-applies changes
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Leverage existing OperationService**: Instead of creating a new dispatcher, we use the already-established OperationService which provides history, telemetry, coalescing, and event emission.

2. **Adapter Pattern**: CommandOperationAdapter bridges the Command and Operation interfaces, allowing Commands to work seamlessly with OperationService.

3. **Commands own their undo logic**: Each command implements its own `undo()` and `redo()` methods, which know how to reverse/reapply their specific changes.

4. **OperationCommit wraps undo/redo**: The adapter creates OperationCommit objects that wrap command undo/redo methods as closures with captured payloads.

5. **Single source of truth**: OperationService is the only entry point for command execution, ensuring consistent lifecycle, history management, and event emission.

6. **No duplication**: We reuse existing HistoryManager, event system, and coalescing logic rather than reimplementing them.

## Testing the Implementation

To test undo/redo functionality:

1. **Open a scene** in the editor
2. **Select a node** in the scene tree
3. **Modify properties** in the inspector (e.g., change position.x from 0 to 5)
4. **Press Cmd+Z / Ctrl+Z**: Property should revert to 0
5. **Press Shift+Cmd+Z / Ctrl+Y**: Property should change back to 5
6. **Test selection**: Select multiple nodes, undo, redo
7. **Test multiple operations**: Make several changes, undo them one by one

## Future Enhancements

1. **History UI**: Add a history panel showing undo/redo stack
2. **Command grouping**: Batch related commands (e.g., all transform changes from a single drag)
3. **History persistence**: Save/load history with projects
4. **Selective undo**: Undo specific operations, not just the last one
5. **History coalescing**: Merge similar consecutive operations (e.g., continuous property changes)
6. **Undo limits**: Configure max history size per user preference

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `src/core/commands/CommandOperationAdapter.ts` - Adapter to bridge Command → Operation
- `src/core/commands/index.ts` - Barrel exports for commands

### Modified:
- `src/core/commands/UpdateObjectPropertyCommand.ts` - Added undo/redo methods
- `src/core/commands/SelectObjectCommand.ts` - Added undo/redo methods
- `src/ui/pix3-editor-shell.ts` - Added keyboard shortcuts, uses OperationService
- `src/ui/object-inspector/inspector-panel.ts` - Uses OperationService with wrapCommand()
- `src/ui/scene-tree/scene-tree-panel.ts` - Uses OperationService with wrapCommand()
- `src/core/rendering/ViewportSelectionService.ts` - Uses OperationService with wrapCommand()

## Compliance with Architecture

This implementation follows the Pix3 architecture guidelines:
- ✅ Commands follow strict lifecycle (preconditions → execute → postCommit)
- ✅ Commands are idempotent
- ✅ Commands emit telemetry events
- ✅ HistoryManager uses bounded stacks
- ✅ Services use dependency injection with `@injectable()` and `@inject()`
- ✅ State mutations only happen through commands
- ✅ UI components subscribe to state changes via Valtio

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for testing
