# Pix3 — Technical Specification

Version: 1.12

Date: 2026-01-01

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

This document describes the technical requirements, architecture, and development plan for the web application Pix3 — a modern editor for creating HTML5 games that combines 2D and 3D capabilities.

### 1.2 Product Overview

Pix3 is a browser-based editor, similar to Figma and Unity, designed for rapid and iterative development of game scenes. It allows working with project files directly through the File System Access API, ensuring tight integration with external IDEs (like VS Code) for code editing.

### 1.3 Target Audience

Pix3 targets professional and indie teams who already create playable ads and interactive experiences with WebGL engines:

- **Playable ad creators** migrating from PixiJS and Three.js pipelines who need scene tooling and rapid iteration.
- **Construct 3 and Godot users** looking for a browser-first workflow with minimal install friction.
- **Cocos and custom engine developers** who want to assemble UI overlays and scene flow visually before exporting to code.

Success metrics:

- Create a new playable ad scene from template to export in under 30 minutes on mid-tier hardware.
- Maintain ≥ 85% editor FPS on a 3-layer (UI + 3D + particle) scene in Chromium browsers on 2023+ laptops.
- Support 90% of user actions via keyboard shortcuts or palette commands within MVP.

### 1.4 Document Scope and Change Management

This specification covers the MVP scope and foundation architecture. Changes are tracked in the changelog at the end of the document.

## 2. Key Features

- Hybrid 2D/3D Scene: The editor does not have a rigid separation between 2D and 3D modes. Instead, it uses a layer system, allowing 2D interfaces to be overlaid on top of 3D scenes — ideal for creating game UIs.
- Godot-style Scene Structure: The scene architecture is based on a hierarchy of "nodes." Each node represents an object (a sprite, a 3D model, a light source). Nodes can be saved into separate scene files (\*.pix3scene) and reused (instanced) within other scenes.
- Local File System Integration: Pix3 works directly with the project folder on the user's disk via the File System Access API. This eliminates the need to upload/download files and provides seamless synchronization with external code editors.
- Multi-tab Interface: Users can open and edit multiple scenes in different tabs simultaneously, simplifying work on complex projects.
- Drag-and-Drop Assets: Project resources (images, models) can be dragged directly from the editor's file browser into the scene viewport to create nodes.
- Customizable Interface: The user can move and dock editor panels to different areas of the window, similar to VS Code, and save their layout between sessions.
- Workspace Presets: Provide opinionated workspace presets (Playable Ad, 3D Scene Authoring, UI Overlay).

### 3.1 Target Platforms

- **Browsers:** Chromium-based desktop browsers (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave) latest two stable versions.
- **Operating Systems:** Windows 11+, macOS 13+, Ubuntu 22.04+ (via Chromium).
- **Hardware Baseline:** Integrated GPU (Intel Iris Xe / AMD Vega) with WebGL2 support, 8 GB RAM, 4-core CPU.

Non-Chromium browsers (Firefox, Safari) are out of scope for MVP but should degrade gracefully by displaying a compatibility banner.

## 4. Architecture

The application is built on the principles of unidirectional data flow and clear separation of concerns.

- **State**: A centralized Valtio proxy (`appState`), serving as the single source of truth for UI, scenes metadata, and selection. It is passive and contains no business logic.
- **Nodes**: Scene nodes (inheriting from Three.js Object3D) are managed by `SceneManager` in `SceneGraph` objects. **Nodes are not stored in reactive state** — only node IDs are tracked in state for selection and hierarchy reference. This separation reduces reactivity overhead and keeps node mutations fast.
- **Operations**: First-class objects encapsulating business logic and state mutations. The `OperationService` is the gateway for executing operations, but all actions must be initiated via **Commands** through the `CommandDispatcher` Service.
- **Commands**: Thin wrappers that validate context (`preconditions()`) and invoke operations via `OperationService`. Commands are registered and discovered via metadata for the command palette. Commands never implement their own undo/redo.
- **CommandDispatcher**: Primary entry point for all user actions. Ensures consistent lifecycle management, preconditions checking, and telemetry for all commands.
- **Command Metadata**: Commands declare menu integration via metadata properties: `menuPath` (menu section), `shortcut` (display), and `addToMenu` (inclusion flag). Menu is generated from registered commands, not hardcoded.
- **Core Managers**: Classes that orchestrate the main aspects of the editor (HistoryManager, SceneManager, LayoutManager). They manage their respective domains and emit events.
- **Services**: Infrastructure layer for interacting with the outside world (FileSystemAPIService, ViewportRenderService, DialogService, LoggingService, FileWatchService). They implement `dispose()` and are registered with DI.
- **UI Components**: "Dumb" components extending `ComponentBase` from `src/fw`. They subscribe to state changes, render based on snapshots, and dispatch commands via CommandDispatcher rather than mutating state directly.
- **Property Schema System**: Godot-inspired declarative property metadata system for dynamic inspector UI generation. Node classes expose editable properties via `static getPropertySchema()`, enabling automatic editor creation.

### Recommended component pattern

Use the `fw` utilities exported from `src/fw` when creating UI components. Example:

```typescript
import { customElement, html, ComponentBase, inject } from '@/fw';

@customElement('my-inspector')
export class MyInspector extends ComponentBase {
  @inject()
  dataService!: DataService; // resolved from fw/di container

  render() {
    return html`<div class="inspector"><h3>Inspector</h3></div>`;
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `ComponentBase` defaults to light DOM but allows opting into shadow DOM via a static `useShadowDom` flag.
- The `inject` decorator automatically resolves services registered with the `fw/di` container. Services can be registered using the `@injectable()` helper in `fw/di`. Ensure `emitDecoratorMetadata` and `reflect-metadata` are enabled within the build configuration.

### 4.1 Core Architecture Contracts

- **Operation Lifecycle (source of truth):** An operation implements `perform(context)` and returns an `OperationCommit` object containing closures for `undo()`/`redo()` and metadata for coalescing. OperationService executes operations, pushes commits to history when requested, emits telemetry, and is solely responsible for undo/redo.
- **Command Lifecycle (thin wrappers):** `preconditions()` → `execute()`; commands delegate to OperationService to invoke operations and never implement their own undo/redo. They remain idempotent and emit telemetry via OperationService.
- **SceneGraph & Node Lifecycle:** `SceneManager` owns a `SceneGraph` per loaded scene. Each `SceneGraph` contains a `nodeMap` (for fast lookup) and `rootNodes` array. Nodes extend Three.js `Object3D` and are **not stored in Valtio state**. State only maintains node IDs for selection and hierarchy reference via `SceneHierarchyState.rootNodes`.
- **HistoryManager Contract:** Maintains a bounded stack of command snapshots, integrates with collaborative locking, and exposes `canUndo`/`canRedo` signals to the UI.
- **Service Layer:** Services implement `dispose()` and must be registered via DI. Singleton services load lazily on first injection.
- **CommandDispatcher Contract:** Executes all commands; invokes preconditions, executes, and handles telemetry. All user actions route through CommandDispatcher.
- **Property Schema Contract:** Node classes implement `static getPropertySchema(): PropertySchema` returning an object with `properties` array, `nodeType`, and optional `groups`. The Inspector uses `getNodePropertySchema()` to retrieve and render properties dynamically. Each property includes `getValue`/`setValue` closures for node interaction.

### 4.2 Glossary

- **Node:** Atomic element in the scene graph representing an entity (sprite, mesh, light).
- **Scene:** YAML document describing root node hierarchy and references.
- **Instance:** Inclusion of another scene file inside the active scene with optional overrides.
- **Preset:** Saved layout configuration.
- **Command:** Unit of business logic that mutates the state and can be undone/redone.
- **Property Schema:** Declarative metadata describing editable properties of a node type, used for dynamic inspector UI generation.

### 4.3 Operations-first Pipeline

- **OperationService:** Central orchestrator for operations. Methods: `invoke(op)`, `invokeAndPush(op)` (also record history), `undo()`, `redo()`. Maintains bounded stacks (default 100 items), clears redo on new pushes, supports coalescing, and emits typed events for UI updates and telemetry.
- **Operation Contract:** `perform()` returns an `OperationCommit` with `undo`/`redo` closures. Optionally includes metadata like affected node IDs and structure flags for efficient scene diffing.
- **Bulk operations:** Tools can compose granular operations into one undo step via a helper that produces a single coalesced commit.
- **CommandDispatcher:** Primary entry point for all actions. All UI panels and tools must use CommandDispatcher to execute commands, ensuring consistent lifecycle management, preconditions checking, and telemetry. Direct invocation of operations via OperationService is discouraged and should be replaced with appropriate commands.
- **Telemetry Hooks:** All mutations flow through OperationService, making it the ideal hook for analytics, autosave, and sync.

### 4.4 Rendering Architecture Notes

- **Three.js Unified Pipeline:** All rendering (3D + 2D) is handled by Three.js to minimize complexity and bundle size. 2D overlays (HUD, selection outlines, gizmos) use an orthographic camera and sprite/material system.
- **Layer Separation:** Logical separation is maintained via internal render phases (viewport pass, overlay pass) rather than different engines.
- **Testing Path:** Planned integration tests validate resize, DPR scaling, and render ordering across the unified rendering pipeline.

## 8. Property Schema System

### 8.1 Overview

Pix3 uses a **Godot-inspired property schema system** for dynamic object inspector UI generation. This system allows node classes to declaratively define their editable properties with type information, validation rules, and UI hints. The Inspector automatically renders appropriate editors for each property type.

### 8.2 Schema Structure

```typescript
interface PropertySchema {
  nodeType: string;
  extends?: string;
  properties: PropertyDefinition[];
  groups?: Record<string, { label: string; description?: string; expanded?: boolean }>;
}

interface PropertyDefinition {
  name: string;
  type: PropertyType;
  ui?: PropertyUIHints;
  validation?: PropertyValidation;
  defaultValue?: unknown;
  getValue: (node: unknown) => unknown;
  setValue: (node: unknown, value: unknown) => void;
}

type PropertyType =
  | 'string'
  | 'number'
  | 'boolean'
  | 'vector2'
  | 'vector3'
  | 'vector4'
  | 'euler'
  | 'color'
  | 'enum'
  | 'select'
  | 'object';
```

### 8.3 Node Schema Example

```typescript
export class Node2D extends NodeBase {
  static getPropertySchema(): PropertySchema {
    const baseSchema = NodeBase.getPropertySchema();
    return {
      nodeType: 'Node2D',
      extends: 'NodeBase',
      properties: [
        ...baseSchema.properties,
        {
          name: 'position',
          type: 'vector2',
          ui: {
            label: 'Position',
            group: 'Transform',
            step: 0.01,
            precision: 2,
          },
          getValue: node => ({ x: node.position.x, y: node.position.y }),
          setValue: (node, value) => {
            node.position.x = value.x;
            node.position.y = value.y;
          },
        },
        {
          name: 'rotation',
          type: 'number',
          ui: {
            label: 'Rotation',
            group: 'Transform',
            step: 0.1,
            precision: 1,
            unit: '°',
          },
          getValue: node => node.rotation.z * (180 / Math.PI), // radians → degrees
          setValue: (node, value) => {
            node.rotation.z = value * (Math.PI / 180); // degrees → radians
          },
        },
      ],
      groups: {
        ...baseSchema.groups,
        Transform: { label: 'Transform', expanded: true },
      },
    };
  }
}
```

### 8.4 Inspector Integration

The Inspector panel uses these utilities:

- `getNodePropertySchema(node)` - Retrieves schema for a node instance
- `getPropertiesByGroup(schema)` - Groups properties by their `group` field
- `getPropertyDisplayValue(node, prop)` - Formats value for display

Property changes are handled through `UpdateObjectPropertyOperation`, which uses the schema's `getValue`/`setValue` methods for semantic transformations.

### 8.5 Custom Editors

Vector and rotation properties use specialized Web Components:

- `Vector2Editor` - Single-row X/Y inputs
- `Vector3Editor` - Single-row X/Y/Z inputs
- `EulerEditor` - X/Y/Z rotation in degrees

Transform group renders with 6-column CSS Grid (1rem 1fr 1rem 1fr 1rem 1fr) with color-coded axis labels (X: red, Y: green, Z: blue).

## 6. Script Component System

### 6.1 Overview

Pix3 includes a script component system for attaching runtime behaviors and controllers to nodes. This system enables game-like interactivity and logic within the scene editor, similar to behavior systems in Unity or Godot.

### 6.2 Script Component Types

The script system supports two component types:

- **Behaviors**: Reusable components that can be attached to multiple nodes. Multiple behaviors can be attached to a single node. Behaviors are ideal for modular functionality (e.g., rotation, physics, animation).
- **Script Controllers**: Primary logic scripts for a node. Only one controller can be attached per node. Controllers typically represent the main behavior or state machine for a node.

### 6.3 Script Lifecycle

All script components (behaviors and controllers) implement the `ScriptLifecycle` interface with the following methods:

- `onAttach(node: NodeBase)`: Called when the script component is attached to a node. Use this to initialize references and set up state.
- `onStart()`: Called on the first frame after attachment, before `onUpdate`. Use this for initialization that depends on the scene being fully loaded.
- `onUpdate(dt: number)`: Called every frame with delta time in seconds. Use this to update state and animate properties.
- `onDetach()`: Called when the script component is detached from a node or scene is unloaded. Use this to clean up resources and remove event listeners.
- `resetStartedState()`: Called when detaching to allow re-initialization on next attach.

### 6.4 Base Classes

- **BehaviorBase**: Abstract base class for behaviors. Extend this class to create custom behaviors. Behaviors expose parameters via `static getPropertySchema()` for dynamic property editing.
- **ScriptControllerBase**: Abstract base class for controllers. Extend this class to create custom controllers. Controllers expose parameters via `static getPropertySchema()` for dynamic property editing.

### 6.5 Script Registry

The `ScriptRegistry` service maintains a mapping of script component type names to their implementation classes. Each class must have a static `getPropertySchema()` method for parameter definitions.

- Register behaviors: `registry.registerBehavior(info: BehaviorTypeInfo)`
- Register controllers: `registry.registerController(info: ControllerTypeInfo)`
- Create instances: `registry.createBehavior(typeId, instanceId)` or `registry.createController(typeId, instanceId)`
- Get property schemas: `registry.getBehaviorPropertySchema(typeId)` or `registry.getControllerPropertySchema(typeId)`

### 6.6 Script Execution Service

The `ScriptExecutionService` manages the game loop and script lifecycle:

- **Game Loop**: Runs `requestAnimationFrame` to tick all nodes in the active scene
- **Node Ticking**: Calls `tick(dt)` on all root nodes, which recursively updates children
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatically calls `onAttach` when scenes load, `onDetach` when scenes unload
- **Start/Stop**: Control script execution via `start()` and `stop()` methods
- **Scene Change Handling**: Detaches old scripts and attaches new ones when scenes change

### 6.7 Behavior Picker

The `BehaviorPickerService` provides a modal dialog for selecting behaviors and controllers:

- Promise-based API: `showPicker('behavior' | 'controller')`
- Search and filtering by name, description, and keywords
- Category grouping for organized display
- Integration with inspector panel for adding scripts

### 6.8 Inspector Integration

The Object Inspector displays a "Scripts & Behaviors" section for each node:

- Lists attached controller (if any) and behaviors
- Provides buttons to add new behaviors or set a controller
- Enable/disable scripts via toggle buttons
- Remove scripts via delete buttons
- Behaviors and controllers expose their parameter schemas for inline editing

### 6.9 Node Integration

Nodes store scripts in two properties:

- `behaviors: Behavior[]` - Array of attached behaviors
- `controller: ScriptController | null` - Single attached controller or null

Nodes implement a `tick(dt)` method that:

1. Updates enabled controller (calls `onUpdate`)
2. Updates enabled behaviors (calls `onUpdate`)
3. Recursively ticks children

### 6.10 Scene Serialization

Scripts are serialized in scene files as part of node definitions:

```yaml
root:
  - id: 'node_001'
    type: 'Node3D'
    name: 'RotatingCube'
    properties:
      position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
    behaviors:
      - id: 'behavior_001'
        type: 'test_rotate'
        enabled: true
        parameters:
          rotationSpeed: 2.5
    controller:
      id: 'controller_001'
        type: 'my_controller'
        enabled: true
        parameters: {}
```

### 6.11 Example Behavior

```typescript
export class TestRotateBehavior extends BehaviorBase {
  private rotationSpeed: number = 1.0;

  constructor(id: string, type: string) {
    super(id, type);
    this.parameters = { rotationSpeed: this.rotationSpeed };
  }

  static getPropertySchema(): PropertySchema {
    return {
      nodeType: 'TestRotateBehavior',
      properties: [
        {
          name: 'rotationSpeed',
          type: 'number',
          ui: {
            label: 'Rotation Speed',
            group: 'Behavior',
            min: 0,
            max: 10,
            step: 0.1,
          },
          getValue: b => (b as TestRotateBehavior).parameters.rotationSpeed,
          setValue: (b, value) => {
            (b as TestRotateBehavior).parameters.rotationSpeed = Number(value);
          },
        },
      ],
      groups: { Behavior: { label: 'Behavior Parameters' } },
    };
  }

  onUpdate(dt: number): void {
    if (!this.node || !(this.node instanceof Node3D)) return;
    this.node.rotation.y += this.rotationSpeed * dt;
  }
}
```

## 7. Scene File Format (\*.pix3scene)

The scene file uses the YAML format to ensure readability for both humans and machines (including AI agents).

### 7.1 Key Principles

- Declarative: The file describes the composition and structure of the scene, not the process of its creation.
- Asset Referencing: Assets (models, textures) are not embedded in the file but are referenced via relative paths with a res:// prefix (path from the project root).
- Composition: Complex scenes are assembled from simpler ones by instantiating other scene files.
- Unambiguous Structure: An explicit children key is used to denote the list of child nodes, which separates the hierarchy from the properties of the node itself.
- Unique Identification: Every node must have an id field. The value is a short, cryptographically secure unique identifier (similar to Nano ID) to provide a balance between file readability and the absolute reliability of references.
- Versioned Schema: Each file includes a `version` field; migrations are maintained in the SceneManager and run automatically on load.
- Conflict Resolution: Instance overrides always win over parent definitions. Duplicate IDs trigger validation errors during import.

### 7.2 Example Structure

```yaml
# --- Metadata ---
version: 1.0
description: 'Main scene for the first level'

# --- Node Hierarchy ---
root:
  # Each node has a unique ID, type, name, and properties
  - id: 'V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT'
    type: 'Node3D'
    name: 'World'
    properties:
      position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
      rotation: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }

    # Explicit definition of child nodes for clarity
    children:
      - id: 'b-s_1Z-4f8_c-9T_2f-3d'
        # Instance of another scene (prefab)
        instance: 'res://scenes/player.pix3scene'
        name: 'Player'
        properties:
          # Overriding instance properties
          position: { x: 0, y: 1, z: 5 }

      - id: 'k-9f_8g-7h_6j-5k_4l-1'
        type: 'MeshInstance3D'
        name: 'Ground'
        properties:
          # Reference to an asset
          mesh: 'res://assets/models/ground_plane.glb'
          scale: { x: 100, y: 1, z: 100 }
```

### 7.3 Validation Rules

- The root section must contain at least one node entry.
- All node IDs must be unique across the entire resolved scene graph.
- `instance` entries must point to existing `.pix3scene` files; SceneManager resolves relative to project root.
- Optional `metadata` block can include analytics tags, localization keys, and QA notes.
- Continuous integration should run schema validation (AJV + generated JSON schema) against committed scene files.

## 9. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Plan

- Establish Vite + TypeScript + Lit project with ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and CI lint/test workflows.
- Implement the basic architecture: AppState with Valtio, Command pattern contracts, and DI container wiring.
- Integrate FileSystemAPIService to open a project folder, list assets, and load `.pix3scene` files.
- Integrate Golden Layout to create a basic layout: Scene Tree, Viewport, Inspector, Asset Browser. Provide layout presets.
- Implement rendering of a simple 3D scene in the viewport using Three.js, including an orthographic pass for 2D overlays.
- Create SceneManager to parse and display the scene structure (`*.pix3scene`) and expose diff events.
- Implement commands for creating primitives (boxes, lights, cameras, sprites) with undoable operations.
- Implement a basic Undo/Redo system using HistoryManager, wired to keyboard shortcuts and UI controls.
- Implement property schema system for dynamic inspector UI generation.
- Implement scene save/load/reload with file watch for external changes.
- Deliver a playable-ad export preset (HTML bundle) and analytics logging stub.

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Maintain ≥ 85 FPS in viewport on baseline hardware. Initial load (cold) < 6s, warm reload < 2s. Command execution should visually update UI within 80ms.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA minimum for editor chrome; ensure keyboard navigation for panel focus and command palette. Provide high-contrast theme preset.
- **Security & Privacy:** Avoid storing project contents on Pix3 servers. Request File System Access permissions per session and cache handles using IndexedDB with user consent. Plugins run in isolated workers and require explicit permission to access services.
- **Reliability:** Autosave layout and session state every 30 seconds. Maintain undo history for at least the last 100 commands.
- **Internationalization:** UI copy uses i18n keys; English and Russian shipped at MVP. YAML scenes may include localized strings via `locale` blocks.

## 12. Roadmap and Milestones

1. **Milestone 0 — Foundation (completed):** Repo bootstrap, DI utilities, layout shell, state scaffolding, CI pipeline.
2. **Milestone 1 — Scene Authoring (completed):** SceneManager MVP, viewport rendering loop, asset browser, primitive tools, property schema system.
3. **Milestone 2 — Playable Export (in progress):** Export preset, analytics stub, undo/redo polish, plugin SDK docs.
4. **Milestone 3 — Collaboration Preview (future):** Shared sessions, commenting, live cursors (post-MVP).

## 13. Change Log

- **1.5 (2025-09-26):** Added target platforms, non-functional requirements, detailed architecture contracts, validation rules, and roadmap updates. Synced guidance on `fw` helpers.
- **1.7 (2025-10-01):** Removed PixiJS dual-engine plan; consolidated rendering to single Three.js pipeline (perspective + orthographic). Updated project structure, removed obsolete adapter references, clarified rendering notes.
- **1.8 (2025-10-05):** Adopted operations-first model. Commands are thin wrappers that delegate to `OperationService`. UI invokes operations directly. Code organized into `core/features/*/{commands,operations}`. Deprecated `CommandOperationAdapter` in documentation.
- **1.9 (2025-10-27):** Updated to reflect current architecture where Nodes are NOT in reactive state. Nodes are managed by SceneManager in SceneGraph objects. State contains only UI, scenes metadata, and selection IDs. CommandDispatcher Service is the primary entry point for all actions. Updated project structure section to annotate (non-reactive) for nodes and clarify state boundaries. Enhanced implementation status with current feature list.
- **1.10 (2025-12-30):** Added comprehensive Property Schema System section (5.0-5.5). Updated technology stack to include Pixi.js v8 for 2D rendering alongside Three.js. Added LoggingService and FileWatchService to architecture. Updated feature list to reflect all implemented commands/operations. Added vector4 property type. Updated MVP plan and roadmap to reflect completed milestones. Added format:check script to project scripts.
- **1.11 (2025-12-30):** Removed Pixi.js from technology stack. Updated to Three.js-only rendering pipeline. Removed Pixi.js references from architecture notes and rendering architecture sections. Updated MVP plan to remove 2D rendering requirements via Pixi.js. Added details about the Icon Service under the Services section.
- **1.12 (2026-01-01):** Added Script Component System section (6.0-6.11). Implemented behaviors and controller scripts attachments in inspector. Nodes now support `behaviors` array and optional `controller`. Added ScriptRegistry service for registering script types. Added BehaviorPickerService for modal dialog. Added ScriptExecutionService for game loop and script lifecycle management. Added commands for Attach/DetachBehavior, Set/ClearController, ToggleScriptEnabled, PlayScene, StopScene. Updated inspector panel to display "Scripts & Behaviors" section. Updated scene tree to show script indicators. Updated project structure to include `behaviors/` directory and `features/scripts/`. Added example TestRotateBehavior implementation. Updated node lifecycle with `tick(dt)` method for script updates.
